      <p>
      My name is Brad Coleman. I am fairly new to web development but have considered it a hobby for several years and have hacked my way through learning various aspects including php, html and mysql.  I am currently enrolled in the Cal Berkeley Extension Web Development Boot camp and am excited to learn web development more holistically.  I have spent my earlier career working as a corporate controller / CPA.
